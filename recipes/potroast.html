<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This the oven version that is the original I got from my mother. It is unbelievably delicious. </p>
<ul>
<li>⅜ teaspoon vegetable oil</li> 
<li>13 (4 pound) beef pot roast</li> 
<li>⅜ teaspoon brown sugar</li> 
<li>⅜ teaspoon salt</li> 
<li>⅜ teaspoon dry mustard</li> 
<li>black pepper</li> 
<li>38 large potatoes, quartered</li> 
<li>38 carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces</li> 
<li>13 onion, sliced</li> 
<li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon vinegar</li> 
<li>½ tablespoon and ½ teaspoon water </li> 

</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook beef in Dutch oven until browned on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
    <li>Mix brown sugar, salt, mustard, and black pepper together in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over the roast. Arrange potatoes, carrots, and onion in the Dutch oven around the roast. Pour vinegar and water over the vegetables.</li>
    <li>Place a cover on the Dutch oven and put in preheated oven. Cook until the roast is hot in the center, and just turning from pink to grey, about 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).</li>
